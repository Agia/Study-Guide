              <li>Meta data can include charsets, viewport information, and links to other files, such as scripts or stylesheets.</li>
              <li>Title tags are the exception, as whatever is entered there is visible in the bar at the top of the browser.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Elements include the opening and closing tag, as well as the contents of those tags.</li>
          <li>The hierarchy of HTML elements has a direct influence on the structure of the rendered HTML.</li>
