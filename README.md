# Prework Study Guide

## Description
A brief collection of knowledge snippets gathered during the pre-work section of bootcamp.

A required component of bootcamp prework in itself, this project also serves other purposes, such as:

- A demonstration of completion of prework
- A potentail source of revision notes.
- An example of the topics touched upon to complete the pre-work, including:
    - HTML, CSS and JavaScript
    - Git, GitHub and the Git flow.
    - Debugging, Dev tools and the console.
    - Potential professional expectations.


## Usage

Each section contains notes about a different web development topic (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git).

When viewing the console on the web page, you can see JavaScript running - listing the topics learned through the prework process, as well as randomly choosing one topic to study first.
